# Mount Olympus Website

This website was created as a final project for my CS 206 Web Development.

I took this course as a major specific elective when I studied abroad in Thessaloniki, Greece during the Fall 2024 semester.

The idea of this project was to create a website of at least 10 pages that illustrated our understanding of the basic concepts of 
HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We were required to have JavaScript on at least one page and had to include five different types of elements
(Div, paragraph, image, form, headers, table, etc.) on each page. We also had to show our knowledge of column usage by implementing at least
one page with a multicolumn design. 

With this in mind, I chose to create a website explaining a historical site I visited and hiked while I was in Greece: Mount Olympus. 

As the highest point in Greece, the mountain is a very popular tourist attraction and has a lot of activities and history surrounding it. 
With this website, I encapsulated parts of this history, the activities, and some of the other amenities that Mount Olympus and its 
surrounding areas offer.

10 page requirement!***
